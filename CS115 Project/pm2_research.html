   <h2>Brief History of TikTok</h2>

        
TikTok as we know it was created in August 2018 when Chinese tech company ByteDance merged their app, Douyin, with Musicall.ly, an app they bought in late 2017. By October 2018, TikTok surpassed Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube in downloads. TikTok grew in popularity throughout 2019 as more media attention surrounded the app and certain users started becoming famous from the app. Once the globe was put on lockdown notices due to COVID-19 in March 2020, TikTok became a social media giant. The app was a form of entertainment for many during lockdown and social distancing, especially Gen-Z and millenials. Once this happened, news publications and media companies ran to TikTok in hopes of gaining new readers (particularly Gen-Z readers) through TikTok.

     <h2>What Separates TikTok from the Rest</h2>
         
         What separates TikTok from other social media news sources is the content you make on it. TikTok is driven by video creation and dances. Because of this, journalistic TikTok users have used popular dance challenges, sounds, and trends on the app in their videos to share news to Gen-Z in a TikTok-esque way. TikTok is like Vine yet realistic for journalists and journalism companies. For example, some doctors on the app use dance challenges to teach viewers the effect COVID-19 has on the body.

    <h2>How TikTok's algorithm Affects The Spread of News</h2>
 
    
Follower count nor engagement rates are taken into consideration with TikTok's algorithm. It is based on what each user likes, interacts with the most, follows, etc. This means it is easier to go viral and become famous on TikTok than other social media app. Thus news publications, media companies, and journalists can make news content that has a high potential of going viral and being seen by millions, driving traffic to their websites. Also, to have a higher chance of being on the For You page it is important for accounts to post frequently. This means TikTok journalism accounts must come up with at least one post a day to grow their account and reach new readers.
<br>
<br>
With all of this said, TikTok's algorithm doesn’t come without faults. Many black users have detailed their experiences of being shadow banned and not shown on the For You page. Users have also found their videos being taken down and shadow banned when calling out racism.

         <h2>TikTok Users Can Make Headlines</h2>
         
         TikTok users can go viral themselves and become news stories. In early February 2021, a woman went viral and became a news story after she switched up gorilla glue spray for hairspray. In early March a woman went viral and became a news story after finding a hidden room behind her mirror in her NYC apartment. There are also TikTok users such as Charli D'Amelio and Addison Rae who have become newsworthy celebrities in Hollywood -- paparazzi and celebrity gossip columns included.

   <h2>Trends Are Created on TikTok</h2>
         
        A lot of trends are popularized on TikTok. Certain clothing, hairstyles, and even quotes from viral TikToks become lingo and go-to topics and sayings for journalists to use in articles. There are even products that go viral on TikTok ranging from remote learning/working essentials to sculpting leggings, which all create media hype.

                <h2>The Blend of The Opinion Piece and News on TikTok</h2>
                
     On TikTok alot of news is spread with user's opinions and commentary attached. This has become a huge competitor to written opinion pieces because many would rather listen to a 15 second to a minute video on a topic than read a long written piece.

     <h2>What are the cons of using TikTok as a news source? (clickbait, native advertising, false news, bias)</h2>

           
           Though popular, verified news publications on TikTok are unlikely to have misinformation issues, regular users can. Also since TikTok is a social media platform having a high follow and engagement rate means influencer deals which can bring about native advertising issues for journalism TikTok accounts.

      <h2>How are online news sources (Washington Post, NBC, etc.) utilizing TikTok?</h2>
                
NBC News has a mini series called “Stay Tuned” which shares news stories in a digestible way to Gen-Z. It started out on Snapchat, and now has an account on TikTok after TikTok’s surge in popularity in March 2020. Angie Grande, the executive producer of Stay Tuned says, “On Snap, we talk to the viewers, not down to them, and on TikTok it’s even more so.” 
<br>
<br>
With almost 900,000 followers, the Washington Post has had one of the most successful TikTok accounts in the journalism industry. The account is run by Dave Jorgensen, who’s dad jokes and self-deprecating humor have created a loyal fanbase.  <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost/video/6917373658663062789?langCountry=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v2">Typical videos on the Washington Post’s TikTok are skits based on current events.</a>


Buzzfeed is passing the baton to teens by putting them in charge. Their TikTok is ran by a group of teen ambassadors who both act and direct/edit/write skits.
<br>
<br>
For more localized papers, like the Dallas Morning News, a lot of their news is based on local city and state news, current events, customs, jokes, etc. “What’s going on in our community that people can relate to across all platforms?”
<br>
<br>
The key to reaching Gen-Z is through relatability and humor. News sites also try to use trending sounds, dances/challenges, and hashtags when making videos.
